# Marketplace

### About
- The Marketplace application uses a MySQL database to allow customers, managers, and supervisors to perform different interactions with a virtual marketplace.
- Customers can place orders for the items in the database.
- Managers can check the inventory of the store, restock the store, and add new products to the store.
- Supervisors can check department sales and add new departments.

### Getting Started
1. Users must first download the files and install the npms in the package-json file.
2. After that, using the app is as simple as using node to invoke the program in the terminal.
